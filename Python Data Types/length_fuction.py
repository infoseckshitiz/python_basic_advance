# length function or len function in python helps us to print length of data 

# in the program below we can see that name is alisha and the printed length of name is 6 


# name = "Alisha"
# length = len(name)
# print(length)
# print(f"The length of {name} is ", len(name))



# write a program to find the character in the name 

# name = input("Enter your name to find the length of character ?")
# print("Your name has " , len(name) , "Characters")


# print the length of the name 
name = "Alisha"
print(len(name))
print(name[0:4])

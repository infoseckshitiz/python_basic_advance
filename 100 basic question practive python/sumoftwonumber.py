# Write a program to find the sum of two numbers.
# Write a program to find the sum of two numbers.

# first method by applying the individual value of a and b 
a = 10
b = 20
sum = a + b 
print("The sum of a and b is :" , sum)
# or you can also print the output in different ways 
print(sum) #this will only print the sum of a and b which is 30

print(f"The sum of a and b is {sum}")

# another method to write program is to ask input for user and print output

x = int(input("Enter the value of x :"))
y = int(input("Enter the value of y :"))
sum1 = x + y
print(f"The sum of two number a and b is {sum1}")

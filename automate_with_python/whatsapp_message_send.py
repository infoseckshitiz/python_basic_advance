"Good morning, my love! ðŸ’– As the sun rises, so does my affection for you. Wishing you a day filled with joy, laughter, and all the love in the world. Know that with each passing moment, I cherish you more deeply. Can't help but count down the moments until we're together again. Missing you already. Take on the day with a smile, knowing you're always on my mind and in my heart. Love you endlessly!",5,59)
